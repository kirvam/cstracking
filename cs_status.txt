As requested I am providing a report on the current status of the Private Cloud Resource Refresh Initiative and its subsequent projects namely,

#1.  Replace Vsheild with pfSense

Current:
-All the necessary pfSense firewall pairs for each customer have been have been created, 26 pairs in total.
-The Cloud Services (CS) team is now working with each customer to confirm and finalize the installation of firewall rules.
-Current customers to be cut-over include EAS, E911, & VCGI.
-NO new infratsructure resources are required to complete this project.

Important:
-We are encountrering many challenges with customers who are not familiar with their firewall rules or the needs of their applications.
-AHS, has just recently designated a specific resourse as a point of contact with for Firewall rules and Networking.
-The pace of this is dependent on the responsiveness of customers.
-Upgrade of VMWARE requires this to be completed for all customers already migrated to VxRack.
-Lastest details can be found here:

#2.  Replace Backup Infrastructure with modern Rubrik solution

Current:
-Additional Rubrik devices will be needed to migrate and backup the remaining customers that still reside in the legacy environment at National Life.

Important:
-It is important to remember that Rubrik provide the mechanism which allows for migration from Legacy (NL) to VxRack (TV).
-Rubrik capacity must always be greate than Storage Utlization in VxRack.
-Rubrik growth must mirror VxRack storage growth.


#3.  Refresh Private Cloud Infratructure
     +Upgrade VMWARE 5.5 in VxRack to 6.01+.
      Current:
      -The target date for this is between May and June 2019.
     
     Important:
      -This is dependent on all customer in the VxRack infrastructure to be "cut-over" to pfSense.
      -There is great concersn about this.
    
     +Replace End of Life (EOL) VNX Storage equipment which hold Private Cloud Storage and File Services (Data Movers).
      Current:
      -Isilon infrastructure has been implemented.
      -Final development of a plan to migrate customers to Isilon from Data Movers (old VNX storage) is ongoing soon to be finsished.
          
     +Migrate customers to Hyper-Converged VxRack at Tech Vault (TV).
      Current:
      -Almost csutomers have been migrated.  (DLC does have a few non-prodcution servers that can be migrated soon.)
      -The last major cusotmers are:
        AHS
        ERP[DHR]
        TAX
