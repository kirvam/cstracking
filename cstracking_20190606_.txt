Hi Mark,

As requested I am providing a report on the current status of the Private Cloud Resource Refresh Initiative and its subsequent projects namely,

#1.  Replace Vsheild with pfSense

Current:
-All the necessary pfSense firewall pairs for each customer have been have been created, 26 pairs in total.
-The Cloud Services (CS) team is now working with each customer to confirm and finalize the installation of firewall rules.
-Current customers to be cut-over include EAS, E911, & VCGI.
-NO new infratsructure resources are required to complete this project.

Important:
-We are encountrering many challenges with customers who are not familiar with their firewall rules or the needs of their applications.
-AHS, has just recently designated a specific resourse as a point of contact with for Firewall rules and Networking.
-The pace of this is dependent on the responsiveness of customers.
-Upgrade of VMWARE requires this to be completed for all customers already migrated to VxRack.
-Lastest details can be found here:
https://vermontgov.sharepoint.com/sites/ADS/EACS/internal/Documents/pfSense%20conversion%20status.xlsx?d=w3a8f999b778e4efa84c61210e8a2d323


#2.  Replace Backup Infrastructure with modern Rubrik solution

Current:
-Additional Rubrik devices will be needed to migrate and backup the remaining customers that still reside in the legacy environment at National Life.

Important:
-It is important to remember that Rubrik provide the mechanism which allows for migration from Legacy (NL) to VxRack (TV).
-Rubrik capacity must always be greate than Storage Utlization in VxRack.
-Rubrik growth must mirror VxRack storage growth.


#3.  Refresh Private Cloud Infratructure
     +Upgrade VMWARE 5.5 in VxRack to 6.01+.
      Current:
      -The target date for this is between May and June 2019.
     
     Important:
      -This is dependent on all customer in the VxRack infrastructure to be "cut-over" to pfSense.
      -There is great concersn about this.
    
     +Replace End of Life (EOL) VNX Storage equipment which hold Private Cloud Storage and File Services (Data Movers).
      Current:
      -Isilon infrastructure has been implemented.
      -Final development of a plan to migrate customers to Isilon from Data Movers (old VNX storage) is ongoing soon to be finsished.
          
     +Migrate customers to Hyper-Converged VxRack at Tech Vault (TV).
      Current:
      -Almost csutomers have been migrated.  (DLC does have a few non-prodcution servers that can be migrated soon.)
      -The last major cusotmers are:
        AHS
        ERP[DHR]
        TAX
      -

Dear Mark,

I am writing as discussed to explain the most pressing current budgetary challenges that lay before us in the next 6 months.

As discussed the following 3 projects needs to succeed as planned in order to adhere to our timelines, minimize risk to data and systems, meet our compliance commitments with the IRS, and avoid paying for unplanned expenses.

Projects:
-pfSense Implementation  -Replacing Vsheild.  Scheduled for May/June 2019.
-VMware Upgrade 5.5 to 6.0+  -Planned for May/June 2019 once all VxRack customers have finished cut-over to pfSense.  Supports IRS Compliance.  
-Migration of remaining customers to VxRack, namely AHS, ERP[DHR], and TAX  -Planned to be completed by end of September, 9/30/2019, before re-occurring M&O expenses.

As discussed, if we DO NOT have the additional infrastructure investments secured for VxRack (2 or 3 units) and Rubrik (2 pairs), we will NOT be able to fully migrate the remaining customers from the legacy environment at National Life (NL) by September 2019.

Also known, over the last year the storage demands of Private Cloud (PC) customers has drastically risen to approximately 60.5% from 2018.  (We are still analyzing this in conjunction with the development of the "Growth Plan" as requested.)

Both of these facts are currently putting enormous pressure on the current timeline and on the Cloud Services team's ability to succeed.  

If we DO NOT meet this timeline we will need to continue operating the End of Life (EOL) legacy equipment at NL and be forced to bear the burden of the extra unplanned expenses.  (Naturally, we would also be subjected to the other risks regarding compliance and data loss as well.)

These UNPLANNED EXPENSES are sizeable and include (but may not be limited to) the following due in October/November 2019:

PROJECTED UNPLANNED LEGACY INFRASTRUCTURE EXPENSES 
  ---------------------------------------------
  VMWare License and SA Renewal         $80,000
  VNX1 and VNX2 M&O                    $302,000
  Data Domain M&O                       $81,000
  ---------------------------------------------
  Total                                $463,000

At this point in time it would be wise to consider publishing these expectations to the wider customer community (IT Customers and Leaders) in the hopes of getting increased engagement and "buy-in".

It also might be a good idea to set the expectation that potential customer intransigence (this is mostly directed at ERP and AHS) may subject customers to additional costs to cover unplanned expenses if they are not able to migrate as planned.

Given the summer vacation season and the already well know scheduling challenges, this approach should probably be published sooner than latter.

Lastly, it is important to note that the remaining customer in legacy have been aware of the need for migration since last June 2018 (again this is mostly directed at ERP and AHS).

I hope this email well captures the information that we have been discussing.

Please advise if there is any other additional information or details your require.  I am happy to make adjustments as you deem necessary.

Make sense?


Sincerely,

-Paul

-------------------------<RBT Rubrik timeline>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have five DNS servers, which have the following roles.

ns0: SOA for all of our public zones
ns1, ns2: authoritative servers for all of our public zones
ns3, ns4: internal recursive resolvers

Ns1-ns4 receive their datums from ns0. Ns1 & ns2 are authoritative for those zones, but ns3 & ns4 are (or should be) configured as stealth slaves, so they should not have to query ns1 & ns2 for records in those zones.

The internet receives answers about our authoritative zones from ns1 & ns2.

Ideally, internal DNS queries would be handled by ns3 & ns4, but a large number of clients still query ns1 & ns2.

What you are asking about is basically queries from the internet for our authoritative zones. That question addresses accessibility of DNS servers if our internet connections are all down (though there are apparently DNS misconfigurations causing resource records to time out prematurely, the correction of which would also address this issue).

But another important question is whether there are clients (or recursive resolvers) that are issuing requests to DNS servers on the internet, rather than sending those requests through ns3 & ns4 (where they can be aggregated into caches). Similarly, all guest network DNS queries are sent to servers that we configure by means of DHCP. Both of these latter issues impact internet bandwidth utilization. (It should be noted that DNS queries are our #1 source of traffic, when measured by number of sessions.)

Anyway, it is tricky to measure the actual relevant traffic, but a general baseline is about 100 MB/hour to each of ns1 & ns2 from hosts outside of our WAN, in the form of about 300,000 distinct queries (per hour).

11 Cloud OPS; Project; 03-18-2019; 11 Cloud OPS; Dan; As you know the Onbase Migration was not successful.<br>It was our understanding that this decision was made due to insurmountable challenges with the application as determined by the Onbase team based upon their developed testing plan.<br>For the most part, when and if a Rollback is requested the Cloud Team will work with our partners to execute this decision until Rollback has been completed successfully.  We did this.<br>It is our understanding that the Rollback was complicated by the fact that validation of the migration required using live data in the Production System necessitating the restore of the SQL database.<br>It was our understanding that the decision to do this was made in coordination and consultation with AHS leadership and that appropriate communication was being handle by the Onbase project team.<br>The Cloud team is currently engaged with AHS to assist in resolving any issues and to re-schedule the migration.<br>Although rare, this is the only second Rollback of any migration, we do plan for this eventuality because sometimes it is necessary.<br>

It is important to note as was shared with CTO, the migration cannot complete with out further storage devices from Rubrik.  This is a high risk issue.

28 RRI Rubrik; Project; 10-23-2018; 28 RRI Rubrik; Jon; Rubrik.  ANR had reported issue with failed backups and with retention for last good backup of Jupiter.  Jon was able to resolve. 
28 RRI Rubrik; Project; 10-23-2018; 28 RRI Rubrik; Team; Rubrik.  Rubrik system as of 10/22 has about 13 TBs of backup capacity remaining. This is not enough to enable the migration of TAX before 12/26 as agreed to with the IRS nor enough to complete the following migrations, AHS and ERP, or ensure stability in backups per the 14 day SLA. The Rubrik system is effectively "out of space". More space will be needed before June 2019. To address this issue the Cloud team has received quotes, negotiated discount, created PO request, received approval from CTO and submitting to ADS IT Purchasing. The team is also drafting an analysis identifying and detailing the allocation of space. The current working assumption is that Rubrik capacity estimates are about 8 months behind due to the less than anticipated compression, more growth than anticipated, resources, delays in migration (which lead to incomplete data picture), and timing. The Cloud Budget shows funding for this. See budget sent to CFO. Purchasing has responded by invoking new procurement rules and requesting a contract Amendment to expand the spending on the current contract and a MEMO explaining the need for such in order to process the procurement.  They also are seeking the approval from the ADS Secretary. The MEMO has been drafted and provided to both CTO and CFO as of 10/18. Currently leadership is working on this issue. We are now waiting in the CTO and leadership.

Hi XXXX,

Sincerely,

-Paul
