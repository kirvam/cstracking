-CTO had me share the following wish list with the SEC who was meeting the GOV:
 #1.  4 - HCI VxRack nodes:  $437,512  -This will allow AHS to fully migrate!
 #2.  2 - Additional Rubrik devices:  $485,000  -This will accommodate backup capacity requirements in parallel with building a DATA PLAN to reduce overall growth.
 #3.  2 - VxRail Disaster Recovery Nodes:  $85,000 -This will accommodate DR for TAX!
 #4.  2 - Dedicated 1 GB Circuits to Equinex in NJ: $80,000 (ESTIMATED)  -This will support IaaS in AWS, Google, AZuer etc.  See attached design from 2016.

# MIGRATION STEPS (Critical Path):
1 Sysadmins  -Turn-off servers.
2 Backup servers, Rubrik.
3 Cloud Service  -Runs vShield script.
4 Networking/Security  -Makes appropriate changes to Network/Firewall settings (as applicable per customer).
5 Cloud Services -Restore servers on the new infrastructure mounting to the Rubrik...
6 Sysadmins  -Restart servers.
7 "Sysadmins and Testers  -Test and confirm server operations.
    -Address and resolve any complications, if any and if possible."
8 Agency Leadership, Sysadmins, and Testers  -Determine STAY or FAIL BACK?
9 "If ALL GOOD; STAY
  OR
If NOT GOOD; FALL BACK  -See FALL BACK steps."

# FALL BACK STEPS:
1 Networking/Security  -Reverse Network/Firewall settings (as applicable per customer).
2 Cloud Services  -Restart original servers.

-------------------------<RBT Rubrik timeline>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have five DNS servers, which have the following roles.

ns0: SOA for all of our public zones
ns1, ns2: authoritative servers for all of our public zones
ns3, ns4: internal recursive resolvers

Ns1-ns4 receive their datums from ns0. Ns1 & ns2 are authoritative for those zones, but ns3 & ns4 are (or should be) configured as stealth slaves, so they should not have to query ns1 & ns2 for records in those zones.

The internet receives answers about our authoritative zones from ns1 & ns2.

Ideally, internal DNS queries would be handled by ns3 & ns4, but a large number of clients still query ns1 & ns2.

What you are asking about is basically queries from the internet for our authoritative zones. That question addresses accessibility of DNS servers if our internet connections are all down (though there are apparently DNS misconfigurations causing resource records to time out prematurely, the correction of which would also address this issue).

But another important question is whether there are clients (or recursive resolvers) that are issuing requests to DNS servers on the internet, rather than sending those requests through ns3 & ns4 (where they can be aggregated into caches). Similarly, all guest network DNS queries are sent to servers that we configure by means of DHCP. Both of these latter issues impact internet bandwidth utilization. (It should be noted that DNS queries are our #1 source of traffic, when measured by number of sessions.)

Anyway, it is tricky to measure the actual relevant traffic, but a general baseline is about 100 MB/hour to each of ns1 & ns2 from hosts outside of our WAN, in the form of about 300,000 distinct queries (per hour).

28 RRI Rubrik; Project; 10-23-2018; 28 RRI Rubrik; Jon; Rubrik.  ANR had reported issue with failed backups and with retention for last good backup of Jupiter.  Jon was able to resolve. 
28 RRI Rubrik; Project; 10-23-2018; 28 RRI Rubrik; Team; Rubrik.  Rubrik system as of 10/22 has about 13 TBs of backup capacity remaining. This is not enough to enable the migration of TAX before 12/26 as agreed to with the IRS nor enough to complete the following migrations, AHS and ERP, or ensure stability in backups per the 14 day SLA. The Rubrik system is effectively "out of space". More space will be needed before June 2019. To address this issue the Cloud team has received quotes, negotiated discount, created PO request, received approval from CTO and submitting to ADS IT Purchasing. The team is also drafting an analysis identifying and detailing the allocation of space. The current working assumption is that Rubrik capacity estimates are about 8 months behind due to the less than anticipated compression, more growth than anticipated, resources, delays in migration (which lead to incomplete data picture), and timing. The Cloud Budget shows funding for this. See budget sent to CFO. Purchasing has responded by invoking new procurement rules and requesting a contract Amendment to expand the spending on the current contract and a MEMO explaining the need for such in order to process the procurement.  They also are seeking the approval from the ADS Secretary. The MEMO has been drafted and provided to both CTO and CFO as of 10/18. Currently leadership is working on this issue. We are now waiting in the CTO and leadership.
28 RRI Rubrik; Project; 10-31-2018; 28 RRI Rubrik; Jon; Rubrik.  The Rubrik system is effectively "out of space".
