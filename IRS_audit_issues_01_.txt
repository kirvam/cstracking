 -See Topology.

Here are the specific responses open from yesterday.

#1.  Updates and Security patches

Answer:
 -We are still trying to track down the last time we did patches for the SAN devices.

#4.  Default password.

Answer:  Yes, changed.

-Updates and Security patches  -Dan to check log!!!
  +VNX's when last update?  Next is October 2018.
  +DD update patches
  +Rubrik versions

-Do we have a Topology?  -Look for that -YES created!!!
  +servers
  +DD
  +VNX's
  +Rubrik's

-Make procedure to Add users/and Review Accounts to give to Tina...  -Paul working on!!!

-Dan do we have a list of accounts in the SAN...  -Yes, see next...
