# MIGRATION STEPS (Critical Path):
1 Sysadmins  -Turn-off servers.
2 Backup servers, Rubrik.
3 Cloud Service  -Runs vShield script.
4 Networking/Security  -Makes appropriate changes to Network/Firewall settings (as applicable per customer).
5 Cloud Services -Restore servers on the new infrastructure mounting to the Rubrik...
6 Sysadmins  -Restart servers.
7 "Sysadmins and Testers  -Test and confirm server operations.
    -Address and resolve any complications, if any and if possible."
8 Agency Leadership, Sysadmins, and Testers  -Determine STAY or FAIL BACK?
9 "If ALL GOOD; STAY
  OR
If NOT GOOD; FALL BACK  -See FALL BACK steps."

# FALL BACK STEPS:
1 Networking/Security  -Reverse Network/Firewall settings (as applicable per customer).
2 Cloud Services  -Restart original servers.
-----------------------------------------------



We have five DNS servers, which have the following roles.

ns0: SOA for all of our public zones
ns1, ns2: authoritative servers for all of our public zones
ns3, ns4: internal recursive resolvers

Ns1-ns4 receive their datums from ns0. Ns1 & ns2 are authoritative for those zones, but ns3 & ns4 are (or should be) configured as stealth slaves, so they should not have to query ns1 & ns2 for records in those zones.

The internet receives answers about our authoritative zones from ns1 & ns2.

Ideally, internal DNS queries would be handled by ns3 & ns4, but a large number of clients still query ns1 & ns2.

What you are asking about is basically queries from the internet for our authoritative zones. That question addresses accessibility of DNS servers if our internet connections are all down (though there are apparently DNS misconfigurations causing resource records to time out prematurely, the correction of which would also address this issue).

But another important question is whether there are clients (or recursive resolvers) that are issuing requests to DNS servers on the internet, rather than sending those requests through ns3 & ns4 (where they can be aggregated into caches). Similarly, all guest network DNS queries are sent to servers that we configure by means of DHCP. Both of these latter issues impact internet bandwidth utilization. (It should be noted that DNS queries are our #1 source of traffic, when measured by number of sessions.)

Anyway, it is tricky to measure the actual relevant traffic, but a general baseline is about 100 MB/hour to each of ns1 & ns2 from hosts outside of our WAN, in the form of about 300,000 distinct queries (per hour).
