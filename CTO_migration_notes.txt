Hi Mark,

As discussed here is a more detailed Migration project update.

Currently most customer have moved or will be moved shortly.  

A small collection of EAS managed servers and DLC will be moved very soon once date set.

EAS Managed:
  -DII, 46, Non-vShield
  -BGS, 12,
  -VLC, 1,

DLC 1,
 
After this he most significant customers remaining in the National Life Legacy environment are:
-AHS
-TAX
-ERP[DHR]

ERP(DHR) can problem move any time.  -Dan is verifying now. 
Tax is ready as soon as we are with VxRack gear in late June 2019.



Challenges
AHS:  
-Lack of human resources and sklls to adddress firewall rules and networking designs.
-Lack of defined initial point of contact.  They have appointed staffer, however they are still getting up to speed.

TAX:
-We did not have enough Rubrik capacity in FALL of 2018 to move.  This was due to the following:
  +Delays in project which extended past the orginal VxRack sizing timeline.
  +Unforseen, unreported, and unexpected resource requirements for ERP Upgrade.
  +JUD's change of heart when it came to funding their DR project.
-At this point TAX and the Cloud team are well prepared to move the 30 TB's

Organic growth of current customers.  There is needs to be more effort to deal with the "Demand Side" to restrain growth.

Managing VDOL after expansion of VxRack

OnBase requirement for 6 more TBs in september.






Messaging:
+Cooperation

Sincerely,

-Paul
